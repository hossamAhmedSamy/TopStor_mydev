       Displays properties for the given datasets.  If no datasets are specified, then the command displays properties for all datasets on
       the system.  For each property, the following columns are displayed:
           [1mname      [22mDataset name
           [1mproperty  [22mProperty name
           [1mvalue     [22mProperty value
           [1msource    [22mProperty source [1mlocal[22m, [1mdefault[22m, [1minherited[22m, [1mtemporary[22m, [1mreceived[22m, or [1m- [22m(none).

       All columns are displayed by default, though this can be controlled by using the [1m-o [22moption.  This command takes a comma-separated
       list of properties as described in the [4mNative[24m [4mProperties[24m and [4mUser[24m [4mProperties[24m sections of zfsprops(7).

       The value [1mall [22mcan be used to display all properties that apply to the given dataset's type ([1mfilesystem[22m, [1mvolume[22m, [1msnapshot[22m, or
       [1mbookmark[22m).

       [1m-H         [22mDisplay output in a form more easily parsed by scripts.  Any headers are omitted, and fields are explicitly separated by a
                  single tab instead of an arbitrary amount of space.

       [1m-d [4m[22mdepth[24m   Recursively display any children of the dataset, limiting the recursion to [4mdepth[24m.  A depth of [1m1 [22mwill display only the
                  dataset and its direct children.

       [1m-o [4m[22mfield[24m   A comma-separated list of columns to display, defaults to [1mname[22m,[1mproperty[22m,[1mvalue[22m,[1msource[22m.

       [1m-p         [22mDisplay numbers in parsable (exact) values.

       [1m-r         [22mRecursively display properties for any children.

       [1m-s [4m[22msource[24m  A comma-separated list of sources to display.  Those properties coming from a source other than those in this list are ig‚Äê
                  nored.  Each source must be one of the following: [1mlocal[22m, [1mdefault[22m, [1minherited[22m, [1mtemporary[22m, [1mreceived[22m, or [1mnone[22m.  The default
                  value is all sources.

       [1m-t [4m[22mtype[24m    A comma-separated list of types to display, where [4mtype[24m is one of [1mfilesystem[22m, [1msnapshot[22m, [1mvolume[22m, [1mbookmark[22m, or [1mall[22m.

       Clears the specified property, causing it to be inherited from an ancestor, restored to default if no ancestor has the property set,
       or with the [1m-S [22moption reverted to the received value if one exists.  See zfsprops(7) for a listing of default values, and details on
       which properties can be inherited.
